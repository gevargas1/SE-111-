    <h2>REVIEW</h2>
    <p>By: <strong>Gerson Vargas</strong></p>
    <p><em>October 26, 2025</em></p>

    <p><em>Legend</em> (2015) is a bold and gritty crime drama that showcases Tom Hardy's incredible versatility as he portrays both Reggie and Ronnie Kray-two real-life twin gangsters who dominated London's underworld during the 1960s.
        The film mixes style and substance, offering an inside look at the brothers' rise to power and their complicated relationship.

    <p>
        Director Brian Helgland balances slick cinematography with dark emotional core.
        Hardy's dual performance is magnetic, making each brother feel completely distinct.
        While <em>Legend</em> delivers plenty of sharp dialogue and brutal action, its strongest moments come from the psychological tension and loyalty between the Krays.
